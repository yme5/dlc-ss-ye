                            When an organization wants to host an app in production (what does this mean?, expand here) (for example, hosting on app on a web server), it quite easy to simply run the app on its intended server OS, and have it consume all the resources It needs. If an organization wanted to host more apps, it was a simple matter of buying more machines. Quickly, virtualization came into the picture(look into this) as a way of hosting multiple applications with different dependencies(look into this) on one machine. However, this required multiple OS’s that also consumed resources. Containerization is a way of hosting multiple apps on the same OS, but keeping them in their own container. Each app thinks its on its own OS, but in fact, they’re all sharing the same OS. This saves space and resources, as the containers use the host OS and libraries. Processing and execution as well as booting up is much faster as compared to virtual machines.                       </p>

                          Docker is a platform that does the containerization mentioned above. It runs on the host OS as mentioned above, and each application is run with its own libraries. That means any app can run in any environment, increasing reliability as well. A containerization platform, like Docker, has three important aspects to creating the container. First is the command file (DockerFile), which is the list of commands that create an image (Docker Image). You run an image to create the container (Docker container). The DockerFile is the plans, and the Docker image is the prototype. The final product that operates the app is the DockerContainer. This step by step system allows for great amounts of control over the container creation while still making deployment easy and secure.
