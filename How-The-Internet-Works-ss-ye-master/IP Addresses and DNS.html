                        Vint Cert and Bob Kahn invented the Internetworking Protocol, which laid the ground work for todays modern internet. Given that the internet is just a mesh of many different networks, how does one communicate from one node to another with minimal interruption? The internet in the words of its creator Vint is that the Internet is “ a design philosophy and an architecture expressed in a set of protocols” The physical technologies that want to join just need to follow the protocol. Each device on the network is assigned an address that designates its location in relation to other networks. This is called its Internet Protocol Address, or IP address. When a packet of information is sent, it is labeled with the source IP address and the recipients IP address. The hierarchy of the IP address is 4 parts, with each part designating a specific network and subsequent subnetwork. This type of IP address is called IPv4, with capacity for 4 billion unique addresses. A newer type of IP address called IPv6 is being implemented to allow more devices with no congestion.                      </p>

                        When you request a website, you type its domain name into your web browser. This domain is registered with ICANN, and it hosted on a domain name server. Often times, the domain name server that you connect to will not know what the IP address of the domain you are trying to connect to is. It will then reach out to other servers to try and find the correct IP address, and once it does, it will return that information, as well as keep a log of that information in its cache in case you or someone else needs to access that domain again in the near future.                       </p>
