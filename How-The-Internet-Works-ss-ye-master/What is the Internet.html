                          Defining the Internet
                      </h1>
                      <p style="font-size:20px;">
                        The Internet is not some abstract magical place, but it also not a centralized technology controlled by a singular entity. It is a group of protocols for information sharing amongst a decentralized network. Invented in the 1970s by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, the modern-day internet was modeled on an earlier DoD project named ARPANET, which was simply a communication system that was designed to survive a nuclear attack. Their solution was to break messages into blocks, or “packets” and send those around the network as fast as possible. In the beginning, ARPANET was limited to large universities. The internet expanded access along the same protocols and allowed anyone to join. Today, the internet is mainly made up of large, independently operated networks. Every operator needs to ensure that there is end to end connectivity between all nodes, but how that is done is up to them, as long as they follow the protocols.                       </p>

                            Why use the Internet
                      </h1>
                      <p class ="text-end" style="font-size:20px;">
                        There is no definite purpose or reason to use the internet but the best reason for its success would be democratizing access to information. As Vint says; “The idea that what you know might be useful to someone else or vice versa is very good motivator for sharing information.” This principle of information sharing with little control has been seen to affect significant real-world events and has pushed the development of a huge number of new technologies. The Internet also motivates the development of applications that can reach a large user base with little effort, if the application is worth using. In the modern day, companies that leverage the internet to power their business are amongst the most profitable companies on the planet.
