                          The amount of information on the internet is very vast. Due to this, data does not travel in a direct fashion. In order to provide reliable connections between data and the user, data travels on the internet in a less direct way. Vint Cerf, who is the co-creator of the internet designed the internet’s protocols and architecture. Information gets transferred from one computer to another through “packets”. They travel through the internet like cars in traffic, taking different routes to get to the same place. IP packets do have limits for example, they cannot carry a huge amount of information in one and instead need several different packets to transport the data. A good example is when an image is too large to be sent through one packet and needs to be divided into smaller parts. Packets have the internet address of where they came from and where they are going.

                       Routers act as traffic monitors to make sure that packets are moving smoothly throughout the different routes. If one route is congested, then other packets will take different routes and arrive at different times or out of order. Packets choose the cheapest available path to get to the correct internet IP address. Cheapest in this case, means time, politics, and relationships between companies. Different paths create fault tolerance and leads to reliability.

                          Transmission Control Protocol, better known as TCP, manages the sending the receiving of packets. It’s similar to a mail service. For example, when you want to listen to a song on Spotify, TCP analyzes all the different packets and ensures that each packet is received. TCP makes note that all the packets have been received and ends the data transfer process. If there are packets that are missing, TCP does not approve the file, and this could result in the song sounding different or off. TCP and router systems are scalable, they can run on 8 or 8 billion devices. The more routers there are, then the more reliable the internet becomes.
