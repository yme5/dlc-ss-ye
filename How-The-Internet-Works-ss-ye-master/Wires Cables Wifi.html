                          Information on the internet is transferred in terms of bits, which is simply an on or off signals. Bits are grouped together in groups of 8 bits, which makes one byte, and 1000 of these bytes make a kilobyte. These can be considered the atoms of the information, or the most basic building blocks of the information being sent around. These bits are sent by three physical mediums; electricity, light and radio. By using a very accurate clock, users on both ends can time information transmission to ensure accuracy. The measure of how much information can be transferred by a device in a given amount of time is called bandwidth, or transmission capacity. Bandwidth is measured by bitrate, which is number of bits per second. The latency of the system is the measure of time it takes for one bit to travel from one node to another. Using copper cable, such an ethernet cable, one can easily and cheaply transmit data, but after 80 meters, signal loss becomes too much to handle. Fiber optic cables use light pulses to increase the bandwidth immensely, but they are expensive and fragile, and require a lot of supporting infrastructure. Finally, radio systems such as WiFi are cheap and easy to implement, but only provide a good signal within a range proportional to their power.                       </p>

                          The purpose of these technologies is to facilitate data transmission. With todays global network, and billions of users, low latency and high reliability are paramount to ensure that everyone has access that is useful. These technologies have been developed and means tested with these results in mind, and after decades of research and production, these are the technologies that won in the end. There have been other technologies that have come and gone, and there is a good chance that these technologies may be replaced as new research and systems come into play, but as long as the new technologies follow the same Internet Protocols, integration is seamless.                       </p>

                      <li style="font-size:20px;">An example of using a copper cable would be connecting your device, like a PC or game console, to your home router. In the United States, the connection between your Router and IXP is also likely to be a copper cable.</li>
                      <li style="font-size:20px;">Using fiber cable is only common in areas with high investment in Internet infrastructure. This is usually limited to corporations with the budget that allows for it as well as a few select cities around the globe.</li>
                      <li style="font-size:20px;">Using radio technology like WiFi is one of the easiest ways to connect to the Internet. Most devices made today will contain a NIC card that allows connectivity, and without it, its difficult fora device to gain mainstream support.</li>
